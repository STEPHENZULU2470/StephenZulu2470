## Hi there 👋

## 👋 Hey, I'm Stephen Zulu

🧑‍💻 Software Engineering student | 🔌 Full-stack developer | 🧠 Product thinker | 🌍 Building for real-life impact

I'm driven by a simple but powerful idea: tech should work beautifully—even offline—and help real people solve real problems. I design and build modular, offline-first desktop apps, business automation tools, and explainable AI systems tailored for local enterprises and critical infrastructure.

💼 What I build:
- ⚙️ Practical tools for everyday businesses: POS apps, sales dashboards, and automation software
- 💾 Robust backend logic using SQLite, Flask, and Node.js
- 🎨 Vibrant, accessible UIs designed for clarity and ease of use

🚀 I code with purpose—writing clean, maintainable architectures backed by thoughtful UI/UX. Each project starts with real needs and ends with usable, demo-ready software that speaks for itself.
